# Potter

My submission to the [Geta Game Jam 7](https://itch.io/jam/geta-game-jam-7).

This is the first real game I made with Unreal Engine 4 (v4.22) as well as my first ever participation in a game jam.

This is a game about a flower named FlowFlow who lost his best friend Pottie. You need to help FlowFlow find his friend as quickly as possible because he simply cannot live without him.

**Key reference:**

| A / Left Arrow        | Go left   |
| D / Right Arrow       | Go right  |
